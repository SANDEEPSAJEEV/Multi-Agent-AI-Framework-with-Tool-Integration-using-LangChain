# Multi-Agent AI Framework with Tool Integration using LangChain

This project demonstrates a LangChain-based multi-agent system where various LLM agents are empowered with external tools and structured workflows to perform complex tasks autonomously. Built in Python and integrated with LangChain and LLM providers, the framework allows orchestration of task-specific agents with memory, custom toolkits, and message history tracking.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔧 **Tool Integration**: Seamless connection with external APIs and Python functions.
- 🧠 **Multi-Agent Execution**: Delegation of tasks across agents using `AgentExecutor`.
- 📜 **LLM Orchestration**: Harness the power of large language models like LLaMA2 through Groq API.
- 🗂 **Memory Management**: Retain conversation history for context-aware interactions.
- 📦 **Modular Design**: Easily extend the agent workflow or plug in new tools.
